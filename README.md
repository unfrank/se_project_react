# WTWR (What to Wear)

## Project Overview

WTWR (What to Wear) is a weather-based clothing recommendation app built with React and Vite. The app provides clothing suggestions based on the current weather in a specified location. Users can view the current temperature and recommended clothing items based on that temperature. Additionally, users can add their own garments to the app by specifying an image, a name, and the suitable weather type.

## Features

- Displays the current temperature and weather conditions based on API data.
- Provides clothing recommendations for different weather types.
- Allows users to add their own clothing items, which appear with the corresponding weather type.
- Shows an enlarged view of each clothing item with a modal component.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Component-based UI library for building the user interface.
- **Vite**: Fast, lightweight build tool for development and bundling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The primary programming language for application logic.
- **CSS Modules**: Component-scoped styles for modular and maintainable CSS.
- **OpenWeather API**: Provides current weather data based on latitude and longitude.
- **Prettier**: Code formatter for consistent code style.
- **Eslint**: Linting tool to enforce coding standards and best practices.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
